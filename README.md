NBA project

This is a small project I created over break where I try and predict the number of 3 point shots that Luka Doncic attempts. No UI rn cuz I did not have time yet. Just input in the oppopents avg height, weight, age, guard defensive rating, and center defensive rating, and number of guards. All these numbers should only be the stats of the starters + 6/7th man. Currently its not super accurate because lack of data, since this season is only half way through, but already pretty accurate for betting over and under his average 3pt attempts per game.
